# Application Name: MENU MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

#### By: David Maina

## Description

The Menu Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline and manage menu items for a hotel. The system allows users to log in, create orders from the menu, and enables administrators to add, edit, and delete menu items. This ensures efficient management of the menu and provides a user-friendly interface for both staff and administrators to handle daily operations.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login functionality allowing only authorized users to access the system.
  - **Staff**: Can log in and create orders from the menu.
  - **Admin**: Can log in, add new menu items, edit existing items, and delete items no longer offered.
- **Menu Management**: Administrators can manage the menu by adding, editing, and deleting items.
- **Order Management**: Staff can create orders by selecting items from the menu and view a list of all orders, including details such as items ordered, quantities, and total cost.

## How It Works

   - Admins can edit existing items by selecting an item from the menu list, updating the details, and saving the changes.
   - Admins can delete items no longer offered by selecting the item and confirming the deletion.
    - Admins can view all items that are in oders that have been created by the staff.
     - Admins can View everything that is on menu list.
    

3. **Staff Functions**:
   - After logging in, staff can create orders by selecting items from the menu and adding them to the order list this will be through adding to cart this will create an order.
   - Staff can search a specific meal that they want from what we offer.
   - Staff can view all created orders, including details such as items ordered, quantities, and total cost.

4. **Order Management**:
